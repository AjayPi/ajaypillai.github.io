<h1 style="color: #1059CD">Mt. Fuji Introduction</h1>

### Mt Fuji’s mission is to provide secure, cloud optionality for Kubernetes

Mt Fuji is a flexible and secure foundation for teams to easily deploy workloads across multiple clouds and collaborate across organizations without detailed knowledge of the underlying cloud.

Based on Kubernetes, the platform is available as a fully managed service which gives teams secure, isolated environments to run their applications on AWS & GCP, integrated into "the Company and Group company services ("The Product", GAC, Github Enterprise). 

Check the <a href= "https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/kubernetes-basics/">Introduction to Kubernetes</a> to get a basic understanding of Kubernetes and its applications.

<h2 style="color: #1059CD"> Why Mt Fuji?</h2>

### Cost. Security. Productivity.

Infrastructure is often a significant obstacle to teams, such as yours, delivering services, often using a significant portion of your time managing infrastructure or facing challenges collaborating with other teams who manage infrastructure for you. This challenge increases in the context or multi organizational challenges in a business like "The Company"'s.

Mt Fuji aims to remove the burden of your teams, managing infrastructure while putting you in control of the workloads, allowing you to deliver faster, scale with business needs, save costs and meet legal and security requirements.

      <b>Infrastructure Complexity</b></span>
   <p>Infrastructure is often a significant burden for developers, with many hours spent learning, building and maintaining rather than developing their  product and delivering value.</p>

     <b>Security</b></span>
<p>Securing Kubernetes infrastructure would not require developers to certified in Kubernetes Security (CSK). Mt Fuji provides secure by default managed infrastructure.</p>

     <b>Team and Organisational Boundaries</b></span>
<p>Collaboration between teams and organisations is often held back by teams each taking their own approach, lack of integration into common services, legal hurdles and security risks.</p>

  <b>Costs</b></span>
<p>With teams and organisations each building, maintaining their own infrastructure; infrastructure and support effort are duplicated with budget not spent efficiently.</p>

  <b>Scale</b></span></span>
<p>Scaling applications to meet business needs is expensive and risky, often involving teams solving the same problems.</p>

# Getting Started

## What is "The Product"?

 * **A suite of development tooling** [(GitHub, Jira, Confluence, Artifactory, etc)](./list-of-tools.md) built and managed in a way that helps solve **Legal, IP and tax challenges** to **enable software development collaboration** between "The Company" and affiliated companies.
 *  A multi-cloud runtime fabric that **allows software to be delivered quickly and securely** by developers who have no knowledge of infrastructure (coming soon)

  What is a "The Product" Project
  </summary>
  </br>
  <p> "The Product" Project has a very specific meaning that is very likely to be different to how projects are defined in your team:</p>
  
<p> A "The Product" Project is a group of resources (e.g. Confluence spaces, GitHub organizations, Jira projects, Artifactory repos, etc) where access is controlled, usually to avoid IP contamination. </p>
  
<p> Therefore a single "The Product" Project usually contains many engineering projects. But it may be possible for a project to need strict controls over the IP of part of it, and therefore it is possible a single engineering project could be spread over multiple "The Product" Projects. </p>
